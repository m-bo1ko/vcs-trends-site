    <h1>History of Version Control Systems</h1>
    <p>The history of version control began in the 1970s with local systems like SCCS and RCS. These tools allowed developers to keep track of code changes but only worked on a single machine.</p>
    <p>In the 1990s, centralized systems such as CVS and later Subversion (SVN) appeared, allowing multiple users to collaborate through a central server. However, these systems suffered from a single point of failure and limited offline capabilities.</p>
    <p>The major shift came with distributed systems such as Git and Mercurial in the mid-2000s. They enabled each developer to have a full copy of the repository, improving speed, reliability, and flexibility.</p>
